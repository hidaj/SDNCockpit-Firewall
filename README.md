Utilising an SDN to Secure an IOT network in a Medical Setting 
CSC7078_KevinBrolly_40313770

Project Scenario


A healthcare centre would like to implement IoT devices into their patient 
monitoring infrastructure as an RFID based patient chart due 
to the inexpensive nature and speed of deployment, they are keen to implement. 

However there have been concerns deploying such devices due to issues 
concerning security, data protection, service continuity and monitoring.

Areas of concern utilising IOT devices includes:
- Lack of device support via firmware/security updates. 
- Weak / default credentials. 
- Device specification limits inbuilt security measures. 
- Issues of maintainability. 
- Due to the inexpensive nature the number of devices 
- can exponentially grow quickly.

These issues provide malicious actors attack vectors to the health 
centres business network, affecting service and potentially 
compromising patient information and safety.
